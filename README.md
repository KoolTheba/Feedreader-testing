# Feed reader testing project

## Context
In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 
The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! 
Unfortunately, he decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. 
That's where you came in.

## Features
- Test suites developed with Jasmine 
- Everything follows the Js Guidelines
- Git-flow has been used.
- Semantic version has been used (semver).
